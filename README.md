## Companion Source Code for C++ Concurrency in Action 2nd Edition

This repository contains the source code from the second edition of [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://www.cplusplusconcurrencyinaction.com/), by Anthony Williams.

The **listings** folder contains the listings from the book. Each file is named `listing_<chapter-number>.<listing-number>.cpp`, so `listing_1.1.cpp` is the first listing in chapter 1, which is marked as listing 1.1 in the book, and `listing_10.3.cpp` is the third listing in chapter 10, which is marked as listing 10.3 in the book.

The source code is released under the [Boost Software License](https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt).
